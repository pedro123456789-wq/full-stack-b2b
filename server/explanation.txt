Nuxt JS scans the ./server directory to register api and server handlers
The urls of the server endpoints are defined automatically by nuxt through the folder structure

Using the useFetch hook, requests are sent to the server and the 
response is fetched before the page rendered and sent to the user.
This way the user is not aware that an external server was used, since they
only see the get request sent to get the page.
